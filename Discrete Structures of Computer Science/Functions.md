Functions are the relationship between members of sets. 

The relation of members of two sets is R:

R ⊆ S<sub>1</sub> x S<sub>2</sub> 

(=) for natural numbers (subset of N x N):

(=) = { (0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2), ... }

f is a function from A to B (f:A→B) 

f(x) = x+1 x∈N f= {(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), ...}

The first number is the assignment, the second is the value/results.
